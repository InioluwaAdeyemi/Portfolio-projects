# Google Capstone Project : Cyclistic bike sharing company

****
**OVERVIEW**

The director of marketing of Cyclistic believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
In this scenario I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the *overall goal of designing marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.* My individual task was to highlight how members differ from casual riders.
